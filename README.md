# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project is used to classify the patients of heart disease according to the previous history using machine learning approach and neural network. we have used Random Forest Classifier
which is a powerful machine learning model used for classification and a Neural network model. Finally, we compared the accuracy of both models.
